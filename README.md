After attending the course for 3 months now, while mostly took classes once per week (only on Sunday). I still learned a lot about Data warehousing. We mostly used **Teradata**. The assignment that was given to me was to explore the [Steam Games Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/code/terencicp/steam-games-data-transformation/notebook) even though it is not perfect. I still had a lot of fun while finishing this assignment.
